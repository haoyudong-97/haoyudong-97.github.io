My name is Haoyu Dong, a forth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Duke University, advised by Prof. Maciej A. Mazurowski. I previously earned my M.S. in Computer Science at Duke and my B.S. in Mathematicsâ€“Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UC San Diego.

My research focuses on foundation models and data-centric AI for medical imaging. I build large-scale vision and visionâ€“language foundation models, develop in-context learning approaches for segmentation, and design multimodal agents that integrate imaging with language and tool use. I am also interested in anomaly detection, test-time adaptation, and clinical decision support, with the broader goal of enabling robust, universal, and clinically meaningful medical AI systems.
